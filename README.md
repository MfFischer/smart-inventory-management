## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
For a detailed explanation of the system‚Äôs architecture, refer to the 
[Architecture Documentation](./architecture.md).

## üìù About the Project
The **Smart Inventory System** simplifies inventory management by enabling 
users to monitor stock levels, track sales, and automate reorder alerts. 
With a focus on streamlined functionality, the system currently supports 
essential features across five primary tables: **products**, **sales**, **users**, **suppliers**, 
and **inventory**. Designed for scalability, this solution will soon expand to include 
additional data tables, which you can preview on the dashboard, making it adaptable 
to growing business needs. Built with Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL, the Smart 
Inventory System offers a reliable foundation for effective inventory control 
and future feature enhancements.
